Development Priorities
======================

We end and start sprints on Tuesdays call. Sprint work is set and handled
through GitHub Issues within a
[milestone](https://github.com/publet/publet/issues/milestones) of when the
sprint ends.

If there are no unblocked tickets in the current sprint, work on bugs/issues
that [have no set milestone](https://github.com/publet/publet/issues?milestone=none&page=1&state=open)

Additional fallback location is to start at the top of the [Trello backlog](https://trello.com/b/9pihnutS/publet)
