## Default to Trello and group chat

* Trello is our backlog, so create cards for feature requests.
* Questions can be asked in group chat if people are working. Limit questions
  to items of the current sprint.
* If someone isn't working or is unavailable, you may @ mention them to send
  them an email for response of a generic question.
* Questions that require response should be asked as comments on
  already-existing issues, cards, todos or other objects within the relevant
  project-management tool.

## Bugs, features and escalation

* A `bug` indicates something is not functioning how code says it should. Many
  things will not function like we would prefer or hope to fix eventually. An
  improvement is a `feature request`.
* Bugs that are affecting core functionality of the Publet tool and making our
  service broken for the majority of users should be immediately created in the
  current `GitHub` milestone and given the `bug` label.
* Bugs in GitHub will be worked on first at the expense of all other sprint
  priorities.
* Bugs that are quirks or problems that can be worked around during the current
  sprint should instead be logged as `Trello` cards and moved to the top of the
  `backlog` to be included in the next sprint.
* Filing bugs in GitHub directly should be reserved for instances of broken
  core functionality and not for something affecting a few isolated users.
