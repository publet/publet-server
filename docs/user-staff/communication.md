Communication
=============

## Weekly

We have a weekly meeting at 2pm EST meant to serve as sprint retrospective and
sprint planning.  Organizational strategy should not be discussed beyond how it
relates to priorities for the next four sprints.

## Daily

We use HipChat to asynchornously talk while working.  If the chatting has to do
with an open ticket, comment directly on that ticket instead of generically in
the HipChat room.  Thread all the comms when possible.

## Immediate

If you need a response
