# Invite new Basic or Pro user to Publet

1.  Create invite codes at `/admin/utils/invite/add/` or get a list of existing
    codes from a superadmin.
2.  Give a potential customer the appropriate code to either activate as Basic
    or Pro.
3.  Potential customer will enter this code during standard user signup process
    at `/signup/`
4.  Check the "Active" box. This is what turns the invite code on.
5.  Set the User Type to "Trial".
6.  Choose Groups to add them to. If their organization already has one or
    more, add them to those. Otherwise create a new Group for them.
7.  Select the Number of codes you want to generate. Each code can be used by
    only one person, but Number allows you to generate several codes with the
    same settings at once.
