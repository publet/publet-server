Google Analytics integration
============================

Group owners have the option of adding a Google Analytics code to their
publications.  The idea is for them to use their own account, independent of
Publet.

First, the owner must add the Google Analytics code to the group's setting.
Given a code of `UA-12345-6`, they would put in `12345`.  This will enable this
feature for all of their publications, and will use the same tracking code for
all of them.

Second, once the above is enabled, they can set a campaign number for each of
their publications.  The owner can create a new Google Analytics campaign under
their account and use the campaign id in Publet.  This allow them to track a
given publication separately from the rest.  In the above example of
`UA-12345-6`, `6` is the campaign id.  In the publication settings, the owner
can set the campaign id.
