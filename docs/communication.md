Communication
=============

## Weekly

We have a weekly meeting at 6pm UTC (5pm UTC in the summer) meant to serve as
sprint retrospective and sprint planning.  Organizational strategy should not
be discussed beyond how it relates to priorities for the next four sprints.

## Daily

We use Slack to asynchornously talk while working.  If the chatting has to do
with an open ticket, comment directly on that ticket instead of generically in
the Slack room.  Thread all the communications when possible.

## Immediate
